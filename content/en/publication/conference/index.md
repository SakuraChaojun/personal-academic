# Abstract.
abstract = "The study uses ancient English words with or without the syllable rules (e.g. “layser” can be considered as an ancient English word follows the syllable rules, and “byynge” does not) to establish whether words syllable influence short-term memory performance. By using ancient English words, the false data caused by early memorizing can be avoid. The hypothesis was that the word follows the syllable rules and is relatively short in length will make the participants more likely to consider the word as familiar. There are three participants involved in this study. PsychoPy was used to collect successful recognition rate for data analysis via manipulating words syllable and lengths. The experiment uses within-group design and can be divided into four groups according to the consistency in syllable rules and word length. The results suggest that words with regular syllable rules have slightly higher recognition rate, but the difference did not reach significant levels, which indicates that the successful recognition rate not critically depends on the syllable rules. Under this circumstance, shorter words length can bring positive effect on successfully recognition. In the future, it is worth exploring whether the same pattern will be observed in other languages."
